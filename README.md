# Project-management-system

## Introduction 
This program is a project management system for a small structural engineering firm. It is used to keep track on the many projects on which they work. The user enters the relevent
information that is needed to either create a new project or edit an existing one. The user can also add different architects, contractors and customer details. The goal of this
project was to help me understanf object-oriented programming.
